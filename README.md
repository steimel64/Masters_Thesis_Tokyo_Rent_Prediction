Rent prediction and real estate value estimation has long had applications in economics, urban development, and public policy. Recently machine learning techniques have been applied to real estate value estimation in the private sector and competitive machine learning competitions with good results. However, there are some challenges with modeling real estate prices due to the amount of factors that contribute to the overall market which can vary based on geographic region. Tokyo, like any other major city in the world has common but also unique factors that contribute to rent pricing and valuation. This paper introduces an approach that uses Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) algorithm LightGBM (LGBM) to predict rent in Tokyo’s 23 special wards based on real estate, geospatial, and environmental features. This approach achieves performance gains through the combination of environmental data sources and feature engineering techniques in comparison to a baseline model that only uses rental features. The proposed model achieves price predictions within 5.01 % and 11,200 yen which is an improvement on the baseline model’s error of 5.91 % and 12,200 yen. This paper also explores the factors that contribute to rent value in Tokyo’s 23 wards based on LightGBM’s optimization from an environmental, geospatial, and feature engineering perspective.
